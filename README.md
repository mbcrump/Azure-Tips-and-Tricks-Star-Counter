Azure Tips and Tricks Star Counter for Google Chrome
====================================================

This a quick google chrome extension that I created to quickly see from my chrome menu how many stars my [Azure Tips and Tricks GitHub repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureTipsAndTricks) has.

Below is a screenshot from my browser.

Instructions for adding to chrome

1) Open Chrome, type chrome://extensions in the address bar and press enter.

2) Check the developer mode checkbox.

3) Press Load Unpacked Extension and browse to the folder where you cloned this repo.

And this would install the extension to your chrome browser.
